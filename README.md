# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake Game built in Python using the `turtle` module.  
Eat the food, grow longer, and avoid hitting the walls or yourself!

## 👨‍💻 About This Project

This was built as part of my Python learning journey (100 Days of Code).  
It helped me learn about:

- Loops  
- Collision detection  
- Classes and object-oriented programming  
- Game logic and timing with `time.sleep()`

---

## 🧠 Developer Reflection

This game taught me how to break logic into clean classes and how movement works using coordinates and directions.  
It was one of the most fun projects to build!

## 📁 Files
