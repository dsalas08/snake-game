# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake Game built in Python using the Turtle module.  
Eat the food, grow longer, and avoid hitting the walls or yourself!

## 👨‍💻 About This Project

This was built as part of my Python learning journey using the **100 Days of Code** course.  
It helped me learn about:

- Loops and game logic  
- Collision detection with food, walls, and tail  
- Classes and object-oriented programming  
- `super().__init__()` and custom class files  
- Screen updates and timing using `time.sleep()`  
- Modular project structure using multiple Python files

## 🧠 Developer Reflection

> _"This game taught me how to break logic into clean classes and how movement works using coordinates and directions. It was one of the most fun projects to build so far!  
Adding collision logic and slicing the list to omit the snake's head made me think harder about how loops interact with objects."_
